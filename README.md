# mail

This is a simple web (read-only) frontend for my particular setup with
notmuch mail. It's very simple at the moment, and likely won't get too
much more complicated in ways that would be useful for anyone but
me. In particular, there is no facility for searching - and won't be
in the near future, if ever. There are also only preset tagging options
(archive and junk).
